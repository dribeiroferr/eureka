## Description

This project was developed due academic reasons and developed all by myself. Let me explain what it is:

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application Programing Interface) that will run in Docker developed in python 3.9. The database choosen for this project was PostgreSQL and it is linked to a real remote database just to make this project more realistic. If it was a "real world application" these data would be protected by environmental variables and it would be added to _.gitignore_ file. 

---

## Before We Get Started

As I mentioned before this application is dockerized, with that in mind you will need to setup docker in your machine, if it is not installed.

## What is Docker ?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
